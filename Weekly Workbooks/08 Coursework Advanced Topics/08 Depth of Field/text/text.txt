All of the rendering techniques we have considered so far on this unit make use of a "naive" representation of a camera.
We have not modelled a physical lens or variable aperture. As a result, our renderers have operated very much like a simple pin-hole camera.
Cameras in the real world however typically have a glass lens and controllable aperture.
These physical features can cause some interesting visual phenomena to appear in the images that are produced by these devices.
View the narrated animation linked to at the top of this section in order to gain an understanding of the concept of "depth-of-field".
Use this knowledge to implement "Bokeh" in your renderer - that is: background (and/or foreground) blur caused by model elements
being positioned _outside_ the zone of lens focus. Note that this feature does not require you to model a refractive glass lens
in your rendered. Rather, you should _simulate_ a Bokeh effect with an appropriate selective blur in your ray tracer.
